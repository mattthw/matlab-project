(f) Answer the following questions in the associated written component for this part of
the project:

(i) Why is it justified to use the LU or QR−factorizations as opposed of calculating
an inverse martix?

Answer: A system of linear equations can be solved using LU or QR factorizations, or using matrix inverses. 
However, matrix inversion is numerically unstable which results in error amplification and loss of precision. 
Additionally, using an inverse matrix will also lead to a loss in efficiency compared to using LU or QR factorizaion.

(ii) What is the benefit of using LU or QR−factorizations in this way? (Your answer
should consider the benefit in terms of conditioning error.)

Answer: Using LU or QR factorization to solve a linear system of equations is more efficient, more accurate, and
more precise. In terms of efficiency, solving a matrix inverse is essentially solving another set of 
linear equations. Additionally you will have to mutiply the inverse by the vector b in 
order to get a solution. The efficiency of solving a system of linear equations with the inverse matrix gets worse as
the size of the system increases, which is why using LU or QR factorization to solve a system of linear equations is 
more efficient. Since matrix inversion is also numerically unstable, using an inverse matrix to solve a system of linear 
equations will be less precise and accurate compared to using LU or QR factorization. This is due to the error amplification
when calculating the inverse and mutiplying the inverse with b to find x.
